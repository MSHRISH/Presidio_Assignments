How Python Work?

Python is a interpreter. 
How to run a python file: $python file.py
Here the "python" is already a binary file i.e set of instructions that can be understood by the processor.
The instructions in "python" binary gets executed along with the filename which contains actual source code
as a parameter input. 
The python interpreter contains two components: PVM(Python Virtual Machine) and a Compiler.
The compiler takes in the source file mentioned in the parameter and converts it into a intermediate code called
"Byte Code", which still can't be understood by the processor. The PVM takes in the generatd Byte Code, and creates
instruction sets that can be executed by the processor.

How to view your byte code?
python -m py_compile file.py

This invokes the python compiler and makes it compile the code and store the Byte Code in a folder called
"_pycache_" in ".pyc" extension.

Human readable Byte File?
python -m dis file.py

This gives a disassembled view of the Byte Code in Human readable format.

Is Python compiled or interpreted?

Uhmm so PVM contains interpreter rather than other way around?!
